# Light-analysis

The purpose of this project is to analyse the light which passes through liquids, using RGB (red, green and blue) values and HLS values. HLS are the properties of light, where H means hue, L means lightness and S means saturation. Hue is the property which identifies the colour, saturation measures the intensity of the colour and lightness is just the brightness of the light.
